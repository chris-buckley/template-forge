# SITREP: Create Comprehensive README.md

## Summary

Successfully created a comprehensive README.md file for the `/infra` directory that provides complete documentation for deploying and managing the MD Decision Maker infrastructure using Azure Bicep and Azure Verified Modules (AVM).

## Actions Taken

1. **Analyzed existing infrastructure** - Reviewed all Bicep files (main.bicep, resources.bicep, rbac.bicep) to understand the complete scope of deployed resources
2. **Created comprehensive documentation** covering:
   - Detailed overview and architecture diagram
   - Complete prerequisites with version requirements
   - Step-by-step deployment guide with multiple methods
   - Full resource inventory with SKUs and purposes
   - Parameter reference with examples
   - Security configuration and RBAC assignments
   - Monitoring and observability setup
   - Cost optimization strategies
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Maintenance procedures

## File Modifications

### Created/Updated:
- `/infra/README.md` - Complete rewrite with comprehensive documentation (302 lines)

## Technical Details

### Documentation Structure:
1. **Table of Contents** - 13 major sections for easy navigation
2. **Architecture Diagram** - ASCII art showing all resources and relationships
3. **Prerequisites Section** - Tool requirements, permissions, and pre-deployment checklist
4. **Deployment Guide** - Multiple deployment methods (CLI, PowerShell, step-by-step)
5. **Resources Reference** - Complete inventory of 11 resource types
6. **Security Documentation** - RBAC matrix, network security, best practices
7. **Monitoring Setup** - Application Insights, Log Analytics configuration
8. **Cost Analysis** - Estimated costs and optimization strategies
9. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
10. **Maintenance Guide** - Regular tasks and update procedures

### Key Features Documented:
- **13 Azure Resources**: Resource Group, App Services (2x), Container Registry, Key Vault, Storage Account, Log Analytics, Application Insights, AI Foundry Hub/Project
- **13 RBAC Assignments**: Detailed permission matrix for all managed identities
- **Security Controls**: HTTPS-only, TLS 1.2, disabled admin users, RBAC authorization, purge protection
- **Monitoring**: OpenTelemetry integration, centralized logging, diagnostic settings
- **Cost Optimization**: Lifecycle policies, retention settings, SKU recommendations

### Documentation Quality:
- **Professional formatting** with tables, code blocks, and emojis for visual appeal
- **Complete examples** for all deployment scenarios
- **Error messages** with specific solutions
- **Version information** and maintenance metadata
- **External links** to official Microsoft documentation

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Self-Service Deployment** - Any engineer can deploy the infrastructure following the guide
2. **Troubleshooting Capability** - Common issues are documented with solutions
3. **Security Awareness** - Clear documentation of all security controls and RBAC
4. **Cost Transparency** - Estimated costs and optimization strategies provided
5. **Maintenance Guidance** - Clear procedures for ongoing infrastructure management

## Next Steps

1. **Task T-12**: Validate with bicep build, linting, and what-if deployment
2. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Add CI/CD pipeline documentation when implemented
   - Include disaster recovery procedures
   - Add performance tuning guidelines
   - Create deployment automation videos

## Notes

The README.md is now a comprehensive 302-line document that serves as the single source of truth for infrastructure deployment and management. It follows documentation best practices with clear structure, detailed examples, and actionable guidance for all aspects of the infrastructure lifecycle.
