# SITREP: Docker Configuration for Local Development

**Task ID:** T-08  
**Summary:** Create Docker configuration for local development  
**Status:** Complete  
**Date:** 2025-06-17  

## Summary of Actions Taken

Successfully created comprehensive Docker configuration for both development and production environments, following Docker handbook best practices and project requirements.

## Files Created

1. **Dockerfile** (Development)
   - Multi-stage build pattern for efficient layer caching
   - Python 3.13-slim base image as specified
   - Non-root user execution for security
   - Health check configuration using /health endpoint
   - Optimized for development with full Python environment

2. **Dockerfile.prod** (Production)
   - Enhanced multi-stage build with security scanning
   - Trivy vulnerability scanning in build process
   - Minimal runtime dependencies
   - Read-only filesystem with tmpfs mounts
   - Removed shell access for production security
   - Optimized for Azure App Service deployment

3. **docker-compose.yml** (Development)
   - Hot reload enabled with volume mounts
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Development-friendly settings (debug logging, docs enabled)
   - Network configuration following handbook (10.88.0.0/24)
   - Resource limits for development
   - Init process for proper signal handling

4. **docker-compose.prod.yml** (Production Testing)
   - Production-like configuration for local testing
   - Strict security settings (no-new-privileges, read-only)
   - Resource limits matching Azure App Service B1 tier
   - No volume mounts for security
   - Required environment variables with validation

5. **.dockerignore**
   - Comprehensive exclusion list
   - Prevents test files, IDE configs, and temp files from build context
   - Optimizes build performance

6. **.env.example** (Updated)
   - Reorganized with clear sections
   - Added Docker-specific settings
   - Complete documentation of all environment variables
   - Security warnings for sensitive values

7. **Makefile**
   - Convenient commands for Docker operations
   - Development workflow shortcuts
   - Production build and test commands
   - ACR push commands for deployment

8. **README.md** (Updated)
   - Merged Docker documentation into main README
   - Comprehensive project overview and API documentation
   - Quick start guide with Docker instructions
   - Development and production workflows
   - Troubleshooting section
   - Best practices and security guidelines

## Technical Implementation Details

### Security Features Implemented
- Non-root user execution (UID 1000)
- Multi-stage builds to minimize attack surface
- Security scanning with Trivy in production builds
- Read-only filesystem in production
- Removed shell access in production containers
- Proper secret handling through environment variables

### Performance Optimizations
- Layer caching optimization in Dockerfile
- Anonymous volumes for Python cache
- Delegated mounts for better macOS performance
- Resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- Health checks for container orchestration

### Development Experience
- Hot reload functionality with volume mounts
- Comprehensive logging configuration
- Easy-to-use Make commands
- Clear separation of dev/prod configurations
- Detailed troubleshooting documentation

## Compliance with Handbooks

✅ **Docker Handbook Compliance:**
- Multi-stage Dockerfile pattern (section 24)
- Proper OCI labels and metadata
- Health check implementation
- Signal handling with init process
- Security best practices (non-root, least privilege)
- Network configuration per handbook recommendations
- Proper error handling and logging

✅ **FastAPI Handbook Integration:**
- Uvicorn configuration with proper flags
- Environment-based configuration
- Health endpoint integration
- Proper Python path setup

✅ **Python 3.13 Compatibility:**
- Using python:3.13-slim base image
- Proper PYTHONPATH configuration
- UV package manager support

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Immediate Benefits:**
   - Consistent development environment across team
   - Easy onboarding for new developers
   - Reduced "works on my machine" issues
   - Quick spin-up of development environment

2. **Production Readiness:**
   - Secure container configuration
   - Optimized image size (~150MB expected)
   - Azure App Service compatibility
   - Proper health checks and monitoring

3. **CI/CD Integration:**
   - Ready for GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps
   - ACR push commands in Makefile
   - Multi-platform build support possible

## Next Steps

1. **Testing:** Run `docker-compose up` to test the configuration (requires Docker Desktop)
2. **Frontend Integration:** Add frontend service to docker-compose.yml when ready
3. **CI/CD Pipeline:** Create build pipeline using these Dockerfiles
4. **Azure Deployment:** Use Dockerfile.prod for App Service deployment
5. **Monitoring Stack:** Consider adding Jaeger service for local tracing

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Build development image
docker-compose build

# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Check health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Run tests in container
docker-compose run --rm backend pytest -v

# Build production image
docker build -f Dockerfile.prod -t md-decision-maker-backend:prod .
```

## Azure Compatibility Updates

After reviewing Azure handbooks, the following updates were made to ensure full compatibility:

### Azure App Service Compatibility
- ✅ `WEBSITES_PORT=8000` environment variable added
- ✅ Proper SIGTERM handling with exec form CMD
- ✅ Health check endpoint at `/health`
- ✅ Single worker process (App Service handles scaling)
- ✅ 30-second grace period for shutdown

### Azure Container Registry Support
- ✅ Multi-architecture build commands added to Makefile
- ✅ Support for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64
- ✅ Proper tagging strategy with git SHA
- ✅ Push commands for ACR in Makefile

### Application Insights Integration
- ✅ `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable
- ✅ `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` with service name and version
- ✅ `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER` configuration
- ✅ OpenTelemetry environment variables

### Azure Key Vault Support
- ✅ `AZURE_KEY_VAULT_URI` environment variable
- ✅ `AZURE_TENANT_ID` and `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` for Managed Identity
- ✅ Ready for secrets management integration

### Documentation Updates
- ✅ Comprehensive Azure deployment guide in DOCKER_README.md
- ✅ Azure CLI commands for App Service deployment
- ✅ Managed Identity configuration steps
- ✅ ACR pull permissions setup

## Final Updates

- **Documentation consolidated:** Merged Docker documentation into main `backend/README.md` following standard practices
- **Removed separate file:** Deleted `DOCKER_README.md` to avoid documentation fragmentation
- **Comprehensive README:** The backend now has a complete README with project overview, API docs, and Docker instructions

## Notes

- Docker Desktop must be running to test the configuration
- The .env file must be created from .env.example before running
- Production image includes security scanning that may increase build time
- Resource limits are set conservatively and can be adjusted based on needs
- Multi-architecture builds require Docker Buildx
- Azure deployment requires appropriate Azure subscriptions and permissions
