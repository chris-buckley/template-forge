# Comprehensive Context

## Original User Query
Create a plan for Updating the globalContext.md file with as much relevant information as possible for both front & backend. I would like technologies used with versions and a dir tree with comments etc.

## Analysis

### SITUATION
The project is an LLM Document Generation PoC (Proof of Concept) that needs comprehensive documentation in the globalContext.md file. Currently, the globalContext.md file contains minimal information - only listing the basic technology stacks without versions or detailed structure. The project consists of a React frontend and FastAPI backend that work together to process user documents and generate Microsoft Word outputs using LLM capabilities. The system is designed to be deployed on Microsoft Azure with a "Generator Style" UX where users submit requests and monitor progress in real-time.

### Comprehensive Analysis - What components are involved in the system and what are their impact?

**Frontend Components:**
1. **React 18.2.0** - Core UI framework providing component-based architecture
2. **TypeScript 4.9.5** - Adds static typing for improved code quality and developer experience
3. **Tailwind CSS 3.2.7** - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
4. **shadcn/ui** - Pre-built, customizable UI components (47 components included):
   - Form controls: button, input, textarea, select, checkbox, radio-group, switch
   - Layout: card, sidebar, sheet, drawer, resizable, separator
   - Navigation: navigation-menu, breadcrumb, menubar, tabs, pagination
   - Feedback: alert, alert-dialog, dialog, toast (sonner), tooltip, hover-card
   - Data display: table, badge, avatar, progress, skeleton
   - Advanced: command palette, calendar, carousel, chart integration
5. **React Router 6.22.3** - Client-side routing for single-page application navigation
6. **React Hook Form 7.57.0** - Performant forms with easy validation
7. **Zod 3.25.62** - TypeScript-first schema validation
8. **Recharts 2.15.3** - Charting library for data visualization
9. **CRACO** - Create React App Configuration Override for custom build configurations

**Backend Components:**
1. **FastAPI 0.115.12** - Modern Python web framework for building APIs
2. **Python 3.13** - Latest Python version for backend development
3. **UV** - Fast Python package manager (uv.lock present)

**Impact Analysis:**
- The frontend is production-ready with a comprehensive UI component library
- The backend is currently minimal and needs implementation of document processing logic
- The system architecture supports real-time updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- TypeScript ensures type safety across the frontend codebase
- The modular component structure enables rapid development and maintenance

### Requirements Analysis

Based on the globalPlan.md, the system requires:

1. **Authentication & Access Control**
   - Single static password for system access
   - Password stored as environment variable in backend

2. **Document Processing Capabilities**
   - Support for multiple file formats: PDF, DOCX, CSV, XLSX
   - Token-based processing strategy:
     - Documents < 40,000 tokens: Process in single context
     - Documents ≥ 40,000 tokens: Use overlapping chunks
   - Sequential document processing

3. **LLM Integration**
   - Pluggable LLM provider architecture (initial target: AI Foundry)
   - Tool-calling capabilities for Python function execution
   - Use of template.docx as decision-making guide

4. **Real-time Progress Updates**
   - Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live status streaming
   - Progress log showing processing steps
   - "Generator Style" UX pattern

5. **Output Generation**
   - Generate single Microsoft Word (.docx) file
   - Store in Azure Blob Storage
   - Provide time-limited download URL

6. **Deployment Requirements**
   - Separate Azure App Services for frontend and backend
   - Secure environment variable management
   - No hardcoded secrets in source code

### Mission
To create a comprehensive and detailed globalContext.md file that serves as the single source of truth for the MD Decision Maker project. This documentation should include:

1. Complete technology stack with exact versions for both frontend and backend
2. Detailed directory structure with descriptive comments explaining each component's purpose
3. Architecture overview showing how components interact
4. Development setup instructions
5. Key dependencies and their roles
6. Configuration details
7. Integration points between frontend and backend
8. Deployment considerations for Azure

The updated globalContext.md will enable developers to quickly understand the project structure, technology choices, and implementation details without needing to explore the codebase extensively.

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Success Criteria for Implementation
- [⏳] Update the existing globalContext.md file with comprehensive project information
- [⏳] Include complete technology stack with exact version numbers
- [⏳] Document full directory structure with descriptive comments
- [⏳] List all major dependencies and their purposes
- [⏳] Include configuration details for TypeScript, Tailwind, and build tools
- [⏳] Provide development setup instructions
- [⏳] Document the architecture and component relationships
- [⏳] Include deployment considerations for Azure
- [⏳] Ensure the documentation is clear and actionable for new developers

### Implementation Subtasks

#### Subtask 1: Update and Enhance Existing globalContext.md
**Objective:** Update the existing globalContext.md file with comprehensive project information

**Context:** The globalContext.md file already exists at `D:\repos\work-microsoft\md-decision-maker\.tasks\docs\globalContext.md` but contains minimal information (only basic technology stack listings). It needs to be significantly expanded with comprehensive information gathered during the analysis phase.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create main sections: Project Overview, Technology Stack, Directory Structure, Architecture, Development Setup
2. Add version-specific technology listings for frontend and backend
3. Include annotated directory tree
4. Document key configuration files and their purposes
5. Add development and deployment instructions

**Specific Implementation with potential code examples:**
```markdown
# MD Decision Maker - Project Context

## Project Overview
[Description of the LLM Document Generation PoC]

## Technology Stack

- React: 18.2.0
- TypeScript: 4.9.5
[... complete listing]

### Backend
- FastAPI: 0.115.12
- Python: 3.13
[... complete listing]
```

**Expected Outcome:**
A comprehensive globalContext.md file that serves as the single source of truth for project understanding and onboarding.

#### Subtask 2: Document Component Architecture
**Objective:** Detail the component structure and relationships

**Context:** The project uses shadcn/ui components with a specific organization pattern that should be documented.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Document the 47 shadcn/ui components and their categories
2. Explain the component composition pattern
3. Detail the styling approach with Tailwind CSS
4. Show integration patterns with React Hook Form

**Expected Outcome:**
Clear documentation of component architecture that helps developers understand and extend the UI.

#### Subtask 3: Development and Deployment Guide
**Objective:** Provide clear instructions for setting up and deploying the project

**Context:** The project is designed for Azure deployment with specific requirements for environment variables and services. No environment templates exist, so deployment configuration needs to be documented clearly.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Document local development setup for both frontend and backend
2. Explain environment variable configuration (note: no .env.example files exist)
3. Detail Azure deployment process for App Services
4. Include Azure Blob Storage setup for document storage
5. Document SSE implementation requirements
6. Add security recommendations for CORS and CSP configuration
7. Include performance optimization opportunities
8. Document accessibility features and best practices

**Expected Outcome:**
Step-by-step guides that enable developers to run the project locally and deploy to Azure successfully.
